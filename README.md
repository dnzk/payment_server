# PaymentServer

PaymentServer is a backend server for bank-like entity, where users can create multiple wallets of different currencies and send money from one wallet to another.
The API uses GraphQL with [Absinthe](https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe).

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Once started, it serves GraphiQL  in `localhost:4000/api/graphiql`.
